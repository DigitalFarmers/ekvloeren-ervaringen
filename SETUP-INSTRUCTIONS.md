# Quick Setup Instructions for DirectAdmin Hosting

## 🚀 5-Minute Deployment

### Step 1: Build Your Project
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and export for static hosting
npm run export
```

### Step 2: Upload to DirectAdmin
1. Open DirectAdmin File Manager or connect via FTP
2. Navigate to `public_html` folder
3. Upload everything from the `out` folder
4. Upload the `.htaccess` file to `public_html`

### Step 3: Setup Database
1. In DirectAdmin, go to **MySQL Management**
2. Create new database: `ekvloeren_db`
3. Create new user: `ekvloeren_user`
4. Import the SQL files from `scripts/` folder:
   - `001-create-tables.sql`
   - `002-update-schema.sql`

### Step 4: Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file in your hosting root:
```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://ekvloeren_user:password@localhost/ekvloeren_db
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

### Step 5: Test Your Site
Visit your domain and test:
- Homepage loads correctly
- Contact form works
- Admin dashboard accessible at `/admin`

## 🔧 What's Been Configured

✅ **Static Export** - Your site now exports to static HTML files  
✅ **.htaccess** - Proper routing and optimization for DirectAdmin  
✅ **Database Support** - MySQL/MariaDB configuration  
✅ **File Uploads** - Ready for DirectAdmin file handling  
✅ **SEO Optimized** - Clean URLs and proper headers  

## 📁 Files You Need to Upload

From your project folder, upload these to `public_html`:
```
out/                 # All static files (generated by npm run export)
.htaccess           # Server configuration (already created)
```

## 🗄️ Database Setup

The application needs these tables (automatically created by SQL scripts):
- `reports` - User submissions
- `report_files` - File attachments  
- `settings` - Site configuration

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**404 Errors?**
- Check that `.htaccess` is in the right place
- Verify mod_rewrite is enabled on your server

**Database Connection Failed?**
- Double-check database credentials in `.env`
- Ensure database user has all privileges

**Images Not Loading?**
- Verify all files from `out/public/` are uploaded
- Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)

## 📞 Need Help?

1. Check DirectAdmin error logs
2. Verify all files uploaded correctly
3. Test database connection in DirectAdmin
4. Ensure your hosting supports PHP and MySQL
